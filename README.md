# Password Generator Starter Code
Password-Generator

Goals of Project
The project was designed for the following user story:

AS AN employee with access to sensitive data I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security

The Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN I need a new, secure password WHEN I click the button to generate a password THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria

WHEN prompted for password criteria THEN I select which criteria to include in the password

WHEN prompted for the length of the password THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters

WHEN prompted for character types to include in the password THEN I choose lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters

WHEN I answer each prompt THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected

WHEN all prompts are answered THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria

WHEN the password is generated THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
